            Henri Lebesgue was born on 28 June 1875 in Beauvais, Oise.
            Lebesgue's father was a typesetter and his mother was a school
            teacher. His parents assembled at home a library that the young
            Henri was able to use. His father died of tuberculosis when Lebesgue
            was still very young and his mother had to support him by herself.
            As he showed a remarkable talent for mathematics in primary school,
            one of his instructors arranged for community support to continue
            his education at the Collège de Beauvais and then at Lycée
            Saint-Louis and Lycée Louis-le-Grand in Paris.

            Born in Venice, he was steered towards mathematics at an early age
            by his teachers and his father, who was himself a teacher of
            mathematics. In 1896 he entered the Scuola Normale Superiore di
            Pisa, where he studied under the notable mathematicians Ulisse Dini
            and Luigi Bianchi. He gained some early fame when his 1900 doctoral
            thesis, entitled Clifford's parallelism in elliptic spaces, was
            discussed in a widely read work on differential geometry published
            by Bianchi in 1902.

            Nikolai Nikolaevich Luzin (also spelled Lusin; 9 December 1883 – 28
            January 1950) was a Soviet/Russian mathematician known for his work
            in descriptive set theory and aspects of mathematical analysis with
            strong connections to point-set topology. He was the eponym of
            Luzitania, a loose group of young Moscow mathematicians of the first
            half of the 1920s. They adopted his set-theoretic orientation, and
            went on to apply it in other areas of mathematics.
